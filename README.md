## What It Does

This code pads characters with colons or otherwise converts them into their emoji form.  Its success will depend on the emoji's currently in your workplace emoji library. If you run this, paste the results into your slack, and some characters aren't converted to emojis, it means your slack is missing the necessary emojis.  You can add them to your slack or pull down this code and modify it to fit your specific library. 

This code was designed to run on Chrome. I cannot promise it will work on other browsers. 

emojify.py is a standalone program with two options for output in the command line. 

emojify.js is designed to be pasted into bookmark's URL bar, and produces output in the form of a browser alert as well as a message in the console log in the developer tools. This is important for output longer than one line in the alert box, which is impossible to highlight and copy.
